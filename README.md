# Event Management System

# Description
The EventHub is a MERN stack event management web application. It makes it very easy to create and organize events. I created it for an organization that I am apart of. We host many events and I wanted to be able to have them all neatly organized in one place. There are lots of features that make it quite efficient to manage the events. Hope you enjoy!
